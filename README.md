# Hard Coded RC
A hardcoded RC car is programmed directly from commands. Unlike autonomous cars, this one follows a specific sequence of movements, with each turn, acceleration, and stop timed down to the millisecond. Itâ€™s like giving the car a script to follow, showcasing how control over timing and direction can create a smooth, pre-planned drive. This project helped me win a number of regional competitions.
